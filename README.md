## Project Overview

We are tasked to analyze and examine weather trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii in order to deterimine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable on the island. We will be using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the meteorological data in a SQLite database. From there we will write queries to examine the temperature data for the months of June and December. 

## Resources

+ Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
+ Software: Python 3.10, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12, VS Code 1.71.0
+ Dependencies: SQLAlchemy

## Results

### Exploratory Climate Analysis

First we looked at yearly precipitation and temperature frequency on the island of Oahu.

| Yearly Precipitation      |  Temperature Frequency    |   
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| ![precipitation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29410712/189555029-49840a18-deda-458c-994d-7236dd84e500.png) | ![temperature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29410712/189555031-a1fbdb88-f4c4-4482-af55-10def03b72fd.png) |

Based on these results, we can see that the average rainfall happens year-round and most of the temperature obsersvations ranged between 70 to 80 degrees. These are ideal conditions for having an ice cream shop business year-round on the island.

The summer and winter average temperatures differ by around 3.9 degrees. As a result, the year-round temperature doesn't fluctuate as much. This weather would be an ideal condition for an ice cream shop business year-round.
